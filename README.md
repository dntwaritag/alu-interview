# alu-interview

In a text file, there is a single character H. Your text editor can execute only two operations in this file: Copy All and Paste. Given a number n, write a method that calculates the fewest number of operations needed to result in exactly n H characters in the file.

Prototype: def minOperations(n)
Returns an integer
If n is impossible to achieve, return 0


Example:

n = 9

H => Copy All => Paste => HH => Paste =>HHH => Copy All => Paste => HHHHHH => Paste => HHHHHHHHH

Number of operations: 6
# Rainwater Trapping Project

This project is designed to solve the problem of calculating the amount of rainwater retained between walls represented by a list of non-negative integers. It follows specific guidelines and requirements.

## Project Requirements

1. The code is written in Python 3.4.3.
2. Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs.
3. All files end with a new line.
4. The first line of all files is `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
5. A `README.md` file is included at the root of the project folder.
6. The code follows the PEP 8 style (version 1.7.x).
7. No external modules are imported.
8. All modules and functions are documented.
9. All files are executable.

## Usage

To calculate the amount of rainwater retained, use the provided `rain` function in the `0-rain.py` file. You can call the function with a list of non-negative integers representing wall heights.

Example usage in `0_main.py`:

```python
walls = [0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 0, 4]
print(rain(walls))  # Output: 6

walls = [2, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 1, 0]
print(rain(walls))  # Output: 6
```

## File Structure

- `0-rain.py`: Contains the implementation of the `rain` function.
- `0_main.py`: Example usage of the `rain` function.
- `README.md`: This documentation file.



# Pascal's Triangle

This Python program generates Pascal's Triangle up to a specified height and returns it as a list of lists of integers. Pascal's Triangle is a mathematical construct where each number in the triangle is the sum of the two numbers directly above it.

## Usage

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.

2. Clone the repository or download the `0-pascal_triangle.py` file.

3. Run the `0-main.py` script to see Pascal's Triangle for a given height. You can adjust the height by changing the input argument in the script.

```bash
$ python3 0-main.py
Function
python
Copy code
def pascal_triangle(n):
    """
    Generate Pascal's Triangle up to the specified height.

    :param n: The height of the Pascal's Triangle.
    :return: A list of lists representing Pascal's Triangle.
    """
n: An integer representing the height of the Pascal's Triangle. Returns an empty list if n is less than or equal to 0.
Example
Here is an example of running the program with a height of 5 in the 0-main.py script:

python
Copy code
from 0-pascal_triangle import pascal_triangle

def print_triangle(triangle):
    """
    Print the Pascal's Triangle.
    """
    for row in triangle:
        print("[{}]".format(",".join([str(x) for x in row]))

print_triangle(pascal_triangle(5))
This will output:

[1,1]
[1,2,1]
[1,3,3,1]
[1,4,6,4,1]
